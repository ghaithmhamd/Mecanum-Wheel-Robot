# Mecanum Robot Wheel ðŸ¤–

Mecanum Robot Wheel is an omnidirectional robotic vehicle using a **PIC16F877A**, **4 Mecanum wheels**, **4 motors**, and **2 L293D H-bridges** for precise movement. It is controlled via **Bluetooth (HC-05)** and features a **piezo buzzer for melody playback**. Programmed with **MikroPascal Pro for PIC**. ðŸš€

## Features
- ðŸ”„ Omnidirectional movement (forward, backward, sideways, diagonal, rotation)
